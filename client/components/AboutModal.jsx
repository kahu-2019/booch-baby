          It takes about two weeks to make a bottle of Booch Baby Kombucha. A
          symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast, or a SCOBY, is put in a
          sweetened tea brew and the bacteria feed on the sugars converting them
          into organic acids, which gives kombucha its iconic tang. The ferment
          is all but halted once weâ€™ve achieved the perfect balance.
